Jump Knight is an arcade based game where you play as a character that wants to collect all the coins. You must dodge bombs to survive. The game runs forever until you die.
The idea is that the main page requests donation of 1 dollar to play one turn, but haven't had time to do that unfortunately. Once donated, funds go to charity. However, this build makes the game run forever.
